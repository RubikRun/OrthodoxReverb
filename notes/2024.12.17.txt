Cloned the repo in my WSL.
Installed the needed libraries to compile ir.lv2
    sudo apt install make gtk2.0 libzita-convolver-dev libsamplerate0-dev libsndfile-dev lv2-dev

Then tried to compile ir.lv2 with make, like that
    sudo make install
It failed because of this type
    _LV2UI_Descriptor (which is typedef'd to LV2UI_Descriptor)
is defined in lv2_ui.h which is not included in ir_gui.cc
I just included it and it worked
    #include "lv2_ui.h"

So now it compiles - it produces and installs these files:
    ir.ttl
    ir_gui.so
    manifest.ttl
    ir.so
We will need to make it produce .dll files instead of .so files.
This can be done with cross-compilation, maybe with
    gcc-mingw32
Figure this out next time.
