On November 13 we talked and planned development of OrthodoxReverb.

Today I created a private GitHub repo in my account called
    OrthodoxReverb
where I will keep notes and any code and related material that I'm working on.

First step is to look for an open source project that we can steal code from.
Deyan has shared a few links in Telegram. I saved them in
    notes/links.txt
