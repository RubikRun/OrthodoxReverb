On November 23 we talked again.
Decided to use this last repo
    https://git.hq.sig7.se/ir.lv2.git
I will delete all other repos from
    ext
Goal now is to compile and run it, see how it works and successfully do IR on some wav file.
Then we have to look at its code and find out if it can be extended to support 6 channels. Currently it supports 1, 2 and 4.

So let's first try to compile it.
Hmm there is a make file and it's made for Linux and it has multiple library dependencies with specific versions, seems complicated.
Continue next time trying to build it with the make file.
