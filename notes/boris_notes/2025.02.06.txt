Today we created a VST plugin with JUCE.

For instructions on how to setup a new JUCE project for a VST plugin see
    howto\HowToSetupJuceProject.txt
For instructions on how to open and build an already existing JUCE project see
    howto\HowToBuildJuceProject.txt
For instructions on how to load a VST plugin in Reaper see
    howto\HowToLoadVstPluginInReaper.txt

I'll add a
    .gitignore
file because the JUCE project directory contains 2 directories that shouldn't really be commited
    Builds
    JuceLibraryCode
