Today we created a VST plugin with JUCE.

For instructions on how to setup a new JUCE project for a VST plugin see
    howto\HowToSetupJuceProject.txt
For instructions on how to open and build an already existing JUCE project see
    howto\HowToBuildJuceProject.txt
For instructions on how to load a VST plugin in Reaper see
    howto\HowToLoadVstPluginInReaper.txt

I'll add a
    .gitignore
file because the JUCE project directory contains 2 directories that shouldn't really be commited

================================================================================================

After we had a basic JUCE project,
we asked ChatGPT how to do the convolution.
It told us to use this class
    juce::dsp::Convolution
from module
    juce_dsp
and told us exactly how to make it work in these functions
    prepareToPlay()
    releaseResources()
    processBlock()
of our class
    OrthodoxReverbPluginAudioProcessor

We couldn't make it work first time,
but after our talk I fixed it.
Now it works!

It doesn't have GUI yet,
and it does the convolution with a hardcoded .wav file
    C:/dev/OrthodoxReverb/examples/Impulse-Response-Deian-2.wav
but other than it works.
