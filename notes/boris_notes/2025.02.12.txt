Last time we were not sure if what we're hearing is the actual reverb file being applied.
Now I looked at the code again, and I noticed the 4-th parameter of this function call
    convolutionProcessor.loadImpulseResponse(irFile,
        juce::dsp::Convolution::Stereo::yes,
        juce::dsp::Convolution::Trim::yes,
        1024);
I wondered what that is. Looking at the declaration of this function in this header file
    juce_Convolution.h
it describes the parameter as follows:
    @param size     the expected size for the impulse response after loading, can be
                    set to 0 to requesting the original impulse response size
So it looks like we need to set that to 0 if we want the whole reverb file to be processed.
Let's try that now
    convolutionProcessor.loadImpulseResponse(irFile,
        juce::dsp::Convolution::Stereo::yes,
        juce::dsp::Convolution::Trim::yes,
        0);
Okay, it worked!
You can hear clearly now that the whole reverb file is being applied.
