HOW TO LOAD A VST PLUGIN IN REAPER:
0.  Install Reaper
1.  Create a directory for your VST plugins, for example
        C:\dev\OrthodoxReverb\plugins
    and copy your generated plugin, the .vst3 file, there.
    Your plugin is usually generated when you build the project in Visual Studio, here:
        OrthodoxReverbPlugin\Builds\VisualStudio2022\x64\Debug\VST3\OrthodoxReverbPlugin.vst3\Contents\x86_64-win\OrthodoxReverbPlugin.vst3
    or if it's a Release build
        OrthodoxReverbPlugin\Builds\VisualStudio2022\x64\Release\VST3\OrthodoxReverbPlugin.vst3\Contents\x86_64-win\OrthodoxReverbPlugin.vst3
2.  Run Reaper
3.  (Do this only the first time)
    HOW TO CONFIGURE REAPER TO LOAD VST PLUGINS FROM YOUR DIRECTORY
        On the bottom left there is a big vertical slider which is the master track.
        Above it there is "Output 1 / Output 2"
        (If you don't see it you have to make the bottom half of Reaper bigger, by draggin up the line that is right below 1.1.00 / 0:00.000)
        Above "Output 1 / Output 2" there is some empty space.
        Click on that empty space, a window will pop up for adding FX to master track.
        In that window go to
           Options -> FX Plug-ins settings...
        In the newly popped up window, on the left side go to
           Plug-ins -> VST
        Then click button
           Edit path list... -> Add path
        and select your directory, where you'll put your VST plugins
           C:\dev\OrthodoxReverb\plugins
        Click Ok.
        Reopen Reaper.
        It should now automatically load your VST plugin, on startup.
4.  Create a new track - Ctrl + T
5.  On the bottom left, next to the master slider, a new slider will appear for your track.
    Above it there is some empty space, divided in two.
    (If you don't see it you have to make the bottom half of Reaper bigger, by draggin up the line that is right below 1.1.00 / 0:00.000)
    Click on the upper half of that empty space, a window will pop up for adding FX to your track.
6.  Search for the name of your plugin
        OrthodoxReverbPlugin
    If it doesn't appear, do this
        FX -> Scan for new plugins
    or just hit
        F5
    Select your plugin and click Add.
7.  A window should appear with your plugin's GUI
    and in the empty space above your track you should see the name of your plugin
        OrthodoxReverbPlugin
