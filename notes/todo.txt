We need the following UI elements:

0. Church selector (dropdown menu)
    Changes the church, changes the IR file.    (DONE)
    Changes the background image.
1. Size (rotation slider) (0.2-2.0) (step 0.05)
    How big is the room
    Changes the actual length of the IR audio, by stretching it
    Predelay grows with size (adds some miliseconds of silence to the beginning of IR audio)
2. Variation (1-5) (rotation slider) (not sure if we want it)
    For every church there will be 5 different variations.
    Just loads 1 of 5 different IR files.
    State should remain when you change churches.
3. Color (boolean switch)
    Light or Dark.
    Implemented with 2 different IR files.
    Changes image.
    State should remain when you change churches.
4. Mix (0-100) (step 1)
    When 0 it's like original signal
    When 100 it's like fully reverbed.
    Between 0 and 100 should be interpolated between original and reverbed.
5. Output (1-150) (step 1)
    Gain
